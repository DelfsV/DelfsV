- 👋 Hi, I’m @DelfsV
- 👀 I’m interested in coding microcontrollers for fun. So far used mainly the Arduino IDE for programming Arduinos as well as the Pi Pico.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use VS code and the GNU toolchain instead of the Arduino IDE. I am sometimes struggling with the makefiles, but it is getting better,
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small projects with the Pi Pico to be used with regards to photography (e.g. timed or event driven controls for flash and cam trigger)
- 📫 How to reach me : volkhard.delfs@gmx.de
